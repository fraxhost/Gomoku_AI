# Gomoku AI

## Overview
This project involves the development of an AI for the board game Gomoku using Flutter. The AI utilizes the minimax algorithm and alpha beta pruning to provide a challenging opponent for human players.

## Features
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Implements the minimax algorithm with situation evaluation to make strategic moves.
- **Alpha Beta Pruning**: Enhances the minimax algorithm by pruning unnecessary branches, improving efficiency.
- **Flutter Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for playing Gomoku against the AI.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on both Android and iOS devices thanks to Flutter.

## Installation
To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gomoku-ai.git
    cd gomoku-ai
    ```

2. Install Flutter dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. Run the app:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## Usage
1. Start the app on your device or emulator.
2. Play Gomoku against the AI through the Flutter interface.
3. The AI will use the minimax algorithm to make its moves.

## Technologies Used
- **Flutter**: For building the cross-platform user interface.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: For strategic decision-making in the AI.
